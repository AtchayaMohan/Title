        Lord Voldemort is an anagram of "Tom Marvolo Riddle." Tom was named after his muggle father, a man he despised and murdered. Tom also means twin in Aramaic, which could be a reference to his connection with Harry Potter.

His middle name, Marvolo, comes from his pure-blood grandfather, Marvolo Gaunt. Tom stole the Gaunt ring and turned it into one of his Horcruxes, unaware that it held The Resurrection Stone. The name Voldemort was created by J.K. Rowling and has French origins, roughly translating to "flight of death."
