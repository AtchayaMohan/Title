        Lord Voldemort is an anagram of "Tom Marvolo Riddle." Tom was named after his muggle father, a man he despised and murdered. Tom also means twin in Aramaic, which could be a reference to his connection with Harry Potter.

        Albus Dumbledore is a man of many layers, a complex man, so it's pretty fitting that he has so many names. Albus is Latin for "white," which could be a reference to his flowing locks. Percival comes from The Legend Of King Arthur and he was one of the Knights Of The Round Table - a brave knight who searched and was given a glimpse of The Holy Grail. Its French meaning is "one who pierces the valley."
